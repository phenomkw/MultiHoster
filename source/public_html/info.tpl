<# SITE_NAME #> is an easy image hosting solution for everyone. Have you ever wanted to share a picture with a friend, or 
many friends, yet did not want to go through the trouble of creating an account at other image host providers, or 
resorting to something as inefficient as email? With this website, you can easily upload any image from your computer 
and share it with anyone in the world! The image is stored on the <# SITE_NAME #> server indefinitely. 
In fact, we are currently hosting <# TOTAL_UPLOADS #> images.
<br /><br />
After uploading an image, the website generates a link to your picture. Copy and paste this link anywhere you want, such 
as a chat client or message board. Just to make it even more easier, <# SITE_NAME #> automatically generates the necessary bbcode ([img] [/img]). All 
you have to do is copy and paste, and the image is instantly viewable. 
<br /><br />
That is all there is to it! If you have any suggestions, comments, concerns, or cries for help, please be sure to <a href="contact.php?act=contact_us">email us</a>.
